<h1>Tech Murmurs — Methodology</h1>

<h2>What Does the Generator Do?</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>
Tech Murmurs is a creative discovery engine designed for vibe coders —
builders who enjoy small, expressive, front-end-friendly projects.
It turns unfinished public intent into approachable side quests.
</p>

<h3>Core Insight</h3>
<p>
Most ideas fail not because they’re bad, but because they’re buried,
indirect, or framed in intimidating language.
Tech Murmurs translates how builders talk into how builders build.
</p>

<h3>The Side Quest Model</h3>
<p>
Ideas are framed as optional, bounded explorations — not mandates.
Each is survivable if abandoned and valuable even when incomplete.
</p>

<h3>Editorial Curation</h3>
<p>
The generator intentionally excludes deep infrastructure, migrations,
and correctness-critical work. It optimizes for clarity, momentum,
and creative confidence.
</p>

<h2>How Does the Generator Work?</h2>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>
Tech Murmurs is a client-rendered web application supported by
serverless ingestion functions that safely proxy public data sources.
</p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<ul>
  <li>GitHub issues and repositories</li>
  <li>Hackathon prompts and submissions</li>
  <li>Public roadmaps and articles</li>
  <li>Developer posts on X</li>
</ul>

<h3>Language Analysis</h3>
<p>
The system uses lightweight heuristics — not opaque AI models —
to detect frustration, confusion, desire language, and repetition.
Infra-heavy and maintenance-only signals are filtered out early.
</p>

<h3>Quest Derivation</h3>
<p>
Raw signals are translated into buildable shapes:
confusion becomes explainers, invisibility becomes dashboards,
and repetition becomes reference tools.
</p>

<h3>Value Framing</h3>
<p>
Each quest includes a “For What It’s Worth” section that reassures
builders why the idea is safe, shippable, and low-regret.
</p>

<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>
Signals are cited as context, not authority.
Sources are shown openly, without implying determinism or prediction.
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
Tech Murmurs does not predict success, viability, or adoption.
It exists to help builders notice what might be worth trying.
